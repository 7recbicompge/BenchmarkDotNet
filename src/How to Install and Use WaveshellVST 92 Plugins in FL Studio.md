## Step 1: Install Waves Plugins Normally
 
First, you need to install Waves plugins normally on your computer. You can download Waves plugins from their official website or use the Waves Central application to manage your licenses and installations. Make sure you install the latest version of Waves plugins and Waveshell-VST 9.2.
 
## Step 2: Open the Plugin Selector from the Mixer
 
Next, you need to open FL Studio and load a project. Then, open the plugin selector from the mixer by clicking on one of the empty slots. You will see a list of available plugins on your computer.
 
## Step 3: Choose One of the Waveshell-VST 9.2 Plugins
 
From the plugin selector, choose one of the Waveshell-VST 9.2 plugins. You will see different versions of Waveshell-VST 9.2 depending on the plugin format (VST or VST3) and bit depth (32 or 64 bit). Choose the one that matches your FL Studio version and preferences.
 
## Step 4: Select the Plugin You Want to Load from the Selector
 
The Waveshell-VST 9.2 plugin will open showing a selector control, containing all the Waves plugins that are available for that specific Waveshell-VST 9.2 plugin. Select the plugin you want to load from the selector and it will open in FL Studio. You can then adjust the plugin settings and parameters as you wish.
 
### Note:
 
If you have updated your Waves plugins, or installed a new one, you must perform a 'Verify plugins' scan in FL Studio with 'Rescan already verified plugins' selected. This is because the Waveshell-VST 9.2 plugin is unchanged and so FL Studio does not know something is new there and won't rescan it to discover your new or updated plugins in the shell.
 
### Troubleshooting:
 
If you encounter any problems with using Waves plugins in FL Studio, here are some possible solutions:
 
- Make sure you have installed the latest version of Waves plugins and Waveshell-VST 9.2.
- Make sure you have activated your Waves licenses using the Waves License Center or a USB drive.
- If you are using Windows 64 bit, make sure you are using compatible versions of Waves plugins and Waveshell-VST 9.2. Older versions of Waves plugins may not work in 64 bit versions of Windows. The workaround for this is to use a program called shell2vst to wrap the Waves plugins into another plugin.
- If you are using a custom VST or VST3 folder, make sure you have added it to FL Studio's plugin search paths.
- If you are using Bluetooth or Ad hoc networks, try disabling them as they may interfere with the Waves license center.
