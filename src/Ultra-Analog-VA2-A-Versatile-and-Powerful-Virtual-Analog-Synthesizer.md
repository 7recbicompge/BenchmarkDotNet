Ultra Analog VA-2 is based on physical modeling, which means that it simulates the behavior of real analog circuits without using any samples. This results in a more realistic and expressive sound quality that can rival some of the best hardware synths. You can also tweak every parameter of the synth to create your own custom sounds, or use the integrated browser and locate function to find the perfect preset for your project.
 
One of the main features of Ultra Analog VA-2 is its flexible signal path. You can choose from different waveforms, sub oscillators, hard sync, and pitch envelopes for each oscillator, and then shape the sound with two multimode filters that can operate in serial or parallel mode. The filters also have distortion and feedback options for adding some grit and character to your sound. You can also modulate any parameter of the synth with two syncable LFOs, four loopable ADSR envelopes, or external MIDI sources.
 
Another feature of Ultra Analog VA-2 is its high quality integrated effects section. You can add some chorus, delay, and reverb to your sound to enhance its depth and width. The effects are also fully modulatable and can be synchronized to the host tempo or MIDI clock. You can also use the master compressor and equalizer to fine-tune your sound and make it fit in the mix.
 
Ultra Analog VA-2 is compatible with most DAWs and supports VST, AU, AAX, and RTAS formats. It also works as a standalone application that can be controlled by any MIDI keyboard or controller. It has a user-friendly interface that is easy to navigate and customize. You can also import and export presets for easy sharing with other users.
 
Ultra Analog VA-2 is a powerful and versatile virtual analog synthesizer that can deliver stunning sounds for any genre or style. Whether you are looking for classic analog tones, modern digital sounds, or something in between, Ultra Analog VA-2 can provide it. You can get it from Applied Acoustics Systems' website for $199 USD[^1^] or try it for free for 30 days.
  
## How to use Ultra Analog VA-2
 
Using Ultra Analog VA-2 is very easy and intuitive. You can start by browsing through the preset library and finding a sound that suits your needs. You can use the browser and locate function to filter the presets by category, bank, or author. You can also use the search box to type in a keyword or a tag. Once you find a preset that you like, you can load it by clicking on it or dragging it to the main window.
 
Once you have loaded a preset, you can modify it to your liking by using the various knobs and sliders on the interface. You can adjust the volume, pan, tuning, glide, and unison of each oscillator, as well as the cutoff, resonance, drive, and feedback of each filter. You can also change the waveform, sub oscillator, hard sync, and pitch envelope of each oscillator by clicking on the corresponding buttons. You can also switch between different filter modes and routing options by clicking on the filter section.
 
If you want to add some modulation to your sound, you can use the modulation matrix at the bottom of the interface. You can choose from different modulation sources and destinations, and adjust the amount and polarity of each modulation. You can also sync the modulation to the host tempo or MIDI clock by clicking on the sync button. You can also use the LFOs and envelopes to modulate any parameter of the synth. You can adjust the shape, rate, phase, and depth of each LFO, and the attack, decay, sustain, and release of each envelope.
 
If you want to add some effects to your sound, you can use the effects section at the top right of the interface. You can choose from different types of chorus, delay, and reverb effects, and adjust their parameters such as rate, depth, feedback, time, mix, and damping. You can also modulate the effects with the LFOs and envelopes by using the modulation matrix. You can also use the master compressor and equalizer to fine-tune your sound and make it fit in the mix.
